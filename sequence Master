Cases that can occur:

n is the size of array
To make sum of k numbers = product of left n-k numbers from an array

1. make all the element as 0
2. for 4 numbers [2 2 2 2] is one possibility
3. for n divisible by 4  the array that can be formed : [-1 -1 -1 n/2]
4 if we have n =2 then we can have 
   [firstelement  firstelement] or [secondelement secondelement] {firstelement, secondelement : first element and second element of the given array}
